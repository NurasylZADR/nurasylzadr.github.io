											<p class="p3" style="width: 70%">Hutch Mansell seems ordinary. He has two children with his wife Becca and an unremarkable office job in his father-in-law Eddie's metal fabrication company. His marriage is strained, and his working life seems tedious.

											One night, an armed man and woman break into his house, and his teenage son, Blake, tackles one of them. Hutch is reluctant to intervene and pleads with his son to release the man, who punches the boy. The thieves leave. The incident causes everyone to think he is a failure. Hutch contacts his brother Harry on a hidden radio in his office and explains that he held back because the burglars were desperate, scared, and using an unloaded gun.</p>
